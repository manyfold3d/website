You can add content to Manyfold by uploading compressed archives, or individual 3d files. Many of the most popular archive formats are [supported](/manual/supported_formats), including ZIP, RAR, 7-Zip, bzip2 and gzip.

You can also upload individual 3d files in any [supported format](/manual/supported_formats); each set uploaded will be collected into a single model.

To upload, click the upload button in the navigation menu. Then drag your content into the dropzone, or browse to select; the files will start to upload immediately. Once the uploads have completed, you can press "create models" to actually save them to your Manyfold library. You should then see them appear over the next little while as the files are extracted and indexed.
