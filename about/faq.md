More questions to come no doubt, but for now, just the one!

## How do you pronounce "Manyfold"?

"man-ee-fold", ([`mænifəʊld`](https://ipa-reader.com/?text=m%C3%A6nif%C9%99%CA%8Ald&voice=Amy) in IPA). It's sort of halfway between "many" (because there are lots of instances) and "manifold" (a term used in 3d printing for solid models).
