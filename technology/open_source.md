Manyfold is [Open Source software](https://opensource.org/osd), published under the [MIT license](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/?tab=MIT-1-ov-file#readme).


## Contributions

As part of Manyfold's development, we've contributed Open Source code back to the community, by releasing a number of our own packages openly (as well as the source code of Manyfold itself):

* [caber](https://github.com/manyfold3d/caber) - a ReBAC / Zanzibar Ruby gem for fine-grained permission control, written for and released by Manyfold.
* [threejs-webworker-3mf-loader](https://github.com/manyfold3d/threejs-webworker-3mf-loader) - webworker-compatible fork of the Three.js 3MF loader
* [wsg-assessment](https://github.com/manyfold3d/wsg-assessment) - a tool to help with DIY assessments against the [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/)
* [tracking](https://github.com/manyfold3d/tracking) - Manyfold's aggressively privacy-protecting usage tracking system

We've also made contributions to a number of the open source projects listed below to help improve them, particularly [Federails](https://gitlab.com/experimentslabs/federails) and [Mittsu](https://github.com/daninithepanini/mittsu).

## Credits

We could not have built Manyfold without standing on the shoulders of all the other Open Source developers who have built the tools we use. There are hundreds of components in our software stack, and we're looking for a good way to credit them all properly, but in the meantime, the most important ones are credited here:
