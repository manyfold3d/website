title: Release v0.107.0
date: 2025-04-09 15:44:30 UTC
---
This release adds some handy new features. First, Manyfold now imports metadata from a datapackage.json file, both on upload and scan. One thing this means is that if you lose your database, you should be able to recover most of your data from the files that are stored on disk along with the models! The other big thing is that now we have API authentication using OAuth; you can create a set of OAuth application credentials, and then use them to access private data using the existing read APIs.

We've also got a new social following page, support for federated unfollows and deletes, support for opening in ElegooSlicer and SuperSlicer, support for HFP and SLDPRT, a new theme, and the usual pile of bugfixes and minor improvements.
