title: Release v0.106.0
date: 2025-04-01 10:56:12 UTC
---
There's a HUGE changelist in this release, because we've spent some time on a whole load of features for people running public servers as well as the usual collection of bugfixes and minor improvements.

All the appearance and customisation options are now built in to the settings pages, so the old SITE_NAME environment variables have gone away; you can also open and close signups from within settings. There's a new about page, a place to specify server rules and a donation link, and a change to how site statistics are displayed which makes more sense for big instances. Add on email notifications, editable fediverse usernames, and the list gets pretty huge!

We also have a brand new translation into Czech, courtesy of @ichlubna, bringing us to 6 languages now!

There's quite a big UI change though - you may notice that libraries have disappeared. We found that in general people don't use them for organisation, and on public instances they're confusing, so we've hidden them away by default. Now they're really just a way to configure storage locations. You can set default library for uploads, and admins can still move models between libraries. Don't worry though, if you want it back how it was before, you can enable the previous behaviour in the site appearance settings.
