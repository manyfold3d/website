Not got enough disk space? Now you can create a library that uses S3-compatible cloud storage instead of local disk! This could be from any of a large number of [open source](https://github.com/okhosting/awesome-storage?tab=readme-ov-file#s3-compatible-file-servers) or [commercial](https://www.storageprovider.info/blog/all-s3-storage-providers/) services - either out on the public Internet, or self-hosted!
