üåü This is a BIG one; Manyfold is going multi-user! üåü

By default it will continue in the same single-user mode you've known up to now, but if you want, you can turn it on.

First thing you'll notice is that you will HAVE to set a password for an administrator user. This user has been there hidden away for ages, but now you need to set a password for it. We do this even if you're staying in single-user mode, so that things are secure if you turn on multiuser later.

To enable multiuser, you'll need to set an environment variable, `MULTIUSER=enabled` in your Docker configuration. You can also set `REGISTRATION=enabled` to allow users to sign up for their own accounts. Otherwise, an admin will need to add new users manually using the advanced administration interface. See our [configuration docs](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/configuration.html) for more details.

In multiuser mode, all users MUST log in to see anything. There are then user roles which an admin can edit in advanced administration:

* `viewer`: read-only access; every user gets this by default.
* `contributor`: can upload models, and create new collections and creators (plus `viewer`).
* `editor`: able to edit and delete content (plus `contributor`).
* `administrator`: all-powerful; the same as the default single-user permissions.

Future releases will add more granular permissions, particularly around edit/create/delete access to individual models, creators, and so on. For now, everyone gets the same access to all content, so be aware, if you're letting friends into your instance, they can see everything!
