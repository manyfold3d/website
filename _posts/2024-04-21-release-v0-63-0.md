Another big feature release this time! Now you can convert inefficient STL and OBJ files to 3MF! For ASCII STLs, there's about a 95% space saving, and it's 50% for OBJ. So, if your disk is creaking at the seams, maybe some conversion is in order!

And, in order to see what's happening with conversions (and why they sometimes fail), there's now a nicer activity log which shows recent background jobs and what they've been doing.
