title: Release v0.69.0
date: 2024-06-20 08:53:01 UTC
---
We had a security audit recently, thanks to NLNet / NGI Zero and Radically Open Security. This release fixes a load of security issues that were found in the audit, many of which fix other bugs at the same time.

The biggest obvious change is that you should now set `PUID` and `PGID` environment variables to specify which user and group Manyfold should run as - before, it would run as root because that's what Docker does by default, and that's obviously a security risk. If you don't set those variables, it will continue to run as root, but it will warn you loudly until you change it! Don't forget to make sure that your libraries are writable by the user you choose!

Visit our new [Security](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/security) page for more details on these and other new options to make your instances more secure!
