title: Release v0.60.0

In this release, Manyfold takes a step inside your files to make sure they're printable! During scan, we look at the mesh structure of OBJ and STL files and make sure they don't have any holes. If they do, we'll raise a Problem so you can investigate further.

Note that this is quite a slow process, so it's not enabled by default. You can turn it on in settings, but even then it won't automatically do it for all the content you've already got. It just analyses new files, or existing files that have changed on since they were last looked at. If you have a pre-existing model you want to check, you can use the new "rescan" button on the model page to start it off.

Also, for you sysadmins, you can now specify your database settings using multiple different variables. Instead of setting `DATABASE_URL`, if you like, you can set the separate parts with `DATABASE_USER`, `DATABASE_PASSWORD`, `DATABASE_HOST`, and `DATABASE_NAME`.
