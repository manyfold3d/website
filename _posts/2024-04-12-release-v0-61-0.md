title: Release v0.61.0

This release brings the ability for your users to recover their forgotten passwords, and stay logged in between browser sessions. The speed of the mesh analysis jobs has also roughly doubled, which makes detecting those holes a bit less expensive.

In order to enable password recovery, you'll need to set up email delivery, which needs a bunch of new environment variables:

Required:

* `PUBLIC_HOSTNAME`: the public hostname (e.g. try.manyfold.app), used for links in emails
* `SMTP_SERVER`: an SMTP server that can be used to send email
* `SMTP_USERNAME`: username for the SMTP server
* `SMTP_PASSWORD`: password for the SMTP server

Optional:

* `PUBLIC_PORT`: if the service isn't on a standard port, specify it here. Also used for the links in the emails.
* `SMTP_FROM_ADDRESS`: The email address that mail should be sent from. Defaults to `notifications@{PUBLIC_HOSTNAME}` if not specified.
