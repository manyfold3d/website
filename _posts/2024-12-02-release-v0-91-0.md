title: Release v0.91.0

This release is all about safety; we've added features for reporting abusive or illegal content, both for local users and across the Fediverse, and for blocking federation to or from particular domains. Federation is still at a very basic level, but we really wanted to get at least some basic safety features in early; it's important stuff! Moderators can view and resolve submitted reports in the new settings area introduced in the last release, and can also manage local accounts in a new user management UI.
