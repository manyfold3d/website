Mostly behind-the-scenes changes and bugfixes this time round; better 3MF conversion behaviour, custom database port support, and fixes for sites that aren't running at the root of their domain. There's also been a big reorganisation of the settings; user-specific settings are now in the same place as password and email, whereas the old settings page is now just for site-wide admin settings.
