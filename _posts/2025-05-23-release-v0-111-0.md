Two new features this release: preview permissions, and... Lego?!

You can now grant "preview" permissions on models; that will let visitors see the model page and any view files set as "previewable" (which is just images by default); the other files are hidden away. This is the first step on our way to support for commercial creators - more to come! 

And then just for fun, we now index and even render LDraw (Lego CAD) models! So, if you've been wanting to show off your best MOCs, well, now you can do it in Manyfold!
