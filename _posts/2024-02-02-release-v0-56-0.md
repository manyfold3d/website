title: Release v0.56.0
date: 2024-02-02 13:02:51 UTC
---
This release is all about better management of collection problems! Last release introduced the ability to change the severity of different problems, and completely turn off some categories if you don't want to know about them.

Now you can also hide individual problems, if you don't care about individual detections, and you can filter the problem list to easily find what you want. Displaying problems is also improved in various places, with more helpful messages and  helpful icons.

Problem detection now also flags models that are missing either images or 3d files, although because these might be noisy, they are turned off by default; you can enable them in settings if you're interested.
