This release brings the ability to merge any models (sets of files) together into one folder!

You can:

* choose an existing model as the primary,
* create a completely new folder with all the contents,
* or create a new model in a shared parent folder; this is particularly useful for those cases where you have what *should* be a model, but just has subfolders in it, no files, so Manyfold hasn't picked it up.
