We had a bug with saving user preferences in the last release, due to a dependency upgrade. We should have caught it, but it slipped by us. It's now fixed, but unfortunately if you experienced the bug, your preferences will be set back to the defaults; fortunately that's just user-level things though, like problem severities, and various display options like renderer, pagination, and tag cloud. Sorry for the inconvenience!
