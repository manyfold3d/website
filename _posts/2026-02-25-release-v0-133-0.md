This is a big one! At long last, Manyfold can now create static image previews of your 3D models thanks to our new friends at [F3D](https://f3d.app), so you can see exactly what you've got without having to load the whole model - but of course, you can still click to load the real thing.

This features is disabled by default, but you can turn it on in the "File Derivatives" settings area. It will start generating images straight away. Beware though, it will use up some disk space, and for large libraries, it will take a while to complete!

There are a couple of high-priority security fixes in this release. The first is a rare problem with session leakage when using an intervening cache, in particular Nginx Proxy Manager. The other was potentially more serious, but was only in unreleased code for a few days, so unless you run `edge` you couldn't have been affected.

We've also got bugfixes for permission editing, sensitive content display, and a few behind-the-scenes issues.
