title: Release v0.66.0
date: 2024-05-12 16:03:50 UTC

On the surface, this release is mostly about more accessibility - keyboard controls for rotating 3d models, correctly-tagged languages, and colour contrast. But in order to do that, behind the scenes the 3d renderer has had a *massive* rewrite, and I hope you'll find it a lot faster and smoother to use!
