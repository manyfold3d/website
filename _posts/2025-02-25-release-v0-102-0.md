Mostly bugfixes and small improvements in this release, but the big news is we're dropping 32-bit ARM builds, because as far as we could tell, nobody was using it anyway. 

ARM is still supported and always will be (same as x86), but only on 64-bit machines now. If you are using an old 32-bit ARM machine (like a Raspberry Pi 2B v1.1 or Zero 1), you will still be able to run everything up to v0.101.0, but sadly you won't get any new releases.
