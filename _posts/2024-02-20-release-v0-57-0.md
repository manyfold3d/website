This release brings the ability to combine supported and unsupported files, and choose whether or not to display them in lists. You can set a supported version for a file manually, but also when you run a scan, Manyfold will try to link them up automatically. To run this on your current library, run a "check existing models" scan after upgrading.

We also have our first translation, into German, thanks to [@ToasterUwU](https://github.com/ToasterUwU) and [@beniroquai](https://github.com/beniroquai)! So, if your browser is set to prefer German, you'll now see almost all of the application text in that language. If you'd like to help with the last few bits of translation, or do another language, [take a look at the README](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=readme-ov-file#internationalisation--translation)!
