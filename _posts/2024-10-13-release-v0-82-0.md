title: Release v0.82.0
date: 2024-10-13 13:28:41 UTC

Exciting times! This release has not one, but TWO major features!

First, Manyfold will now index PDF, TXT, Markdown and video files. All those models that come with build instructions, licenses, and so on? Now you can see it all!

The second is another big step on something we've been building towards for a long time; Manyfold is now social! Users of [Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/) social networks, using systems like Mastodon, can follow Manyfold creators, collections or individual models. As of this release, if you've followed a creator, when they add a new model, you'll see an update in your feed!

Future releases will add more update types, and will allow you to subscribe directly to content on one Manyfold server from another, so stay tuned for more!
