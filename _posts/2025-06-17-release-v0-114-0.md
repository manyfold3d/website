More updates and fixes for public instances in this release that we've identified during our beta testing. The main change is that now there's an option to automatically create a Creator record when a new user signs up for an account. Personal sites probably won't want to do that so it's disabled by default, but if you're running a public instance, it should make it easier for people to get started!
