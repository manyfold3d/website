This time round, we've got a new permission option during upload, so you can easily make models public straight away, and there's a default site-wide setting for that option so you can make it extra easy for users!

We've also got improvements for translators, with a new environment option that enables "experimental" languages (i.e. ones that are only partially translated) in the running app, and the addition of an experimental Chinese (zh-CN) translation which is currently being worked on by our amazing volunteer translators.

There are also big improvements to the speed of some mesh operations, as we've moved to a new more efficient library for file conversion. 3MF conversion now happens quickly, even for large meshes, and the change we've made will allow more conversion options in future.
