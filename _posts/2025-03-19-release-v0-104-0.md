title: Release v0.104.0
date: 2025-03-19 10:00:29 UTC
---
This release makes it easier to include content from Manyfold elsewhere on the web, by adding support for the oEmbed standard. On many blog platforms, you should now be able to just paste in a public model, creator or collection URL, and get a nice preview. If the platform you're using allows it, you might even get a proper 3D view if you've got a model selected as the preview file!

We've also got two long-requested features for you; deleting libraries (finally), and the ability to open a file directly in your slicer. Currently OrcaSlicer and Cura are supported, but we will add more in future when we can! We could do PrusaSlicer and Bambu Studio as well, but they will only open files from Printables or Makerworld respectively; perhaps in time we can convince them to open that up a bit.
