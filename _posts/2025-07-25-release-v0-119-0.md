title: Release v0.119.0
date: 2025-07-25 14:49:42 UTC
---
This is mostly a bugfix release for sync features and zip downloads, but there's one new efficiency feature as well. You can now enable creation of image thumbnails, which should help the list pages load faster.

That uses some disk space though, so it's optional; enable it in the "Downloads" settings area (no, that's not really a good place for it, a settings reorganisation is probably going to have to happen soon).
