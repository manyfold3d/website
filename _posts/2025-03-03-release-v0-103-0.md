title: Release v0.103.0
date: 2025-03-03 14:08:19 UTC
---
This release lets you associate collections with creators, letting you group collections together by creator. We've also got the first release of our new [model metadata format](https://manyfold.app/technology/packaging.html); this is a file that's included on disk with your files, and in downloads, that includes all the metadata associated with a model. This is an open standard, and we hope that other 3d hosting sites will start using it as well, thus making transferring models between services much easier.

There's also the usual collection of bugfixes and some efficiency improvements, and a new password strength meter which shows whether or not a password is strong enough as you type it in.
