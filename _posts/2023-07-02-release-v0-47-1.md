Second attempt at releasing v0.47.0 (after a quick bugfix in the build), with a few small features to make library management easier. 

NOTE: you may find some of your creators or collections get renamed when upgrading; this is because creator and collection names are now required to be unique! The application will check this when you upgrade, and if there are any conflicts, it will add some random numbers to the end of the name.
