Big news, with long-awaited improvements to uploading in this release. The upload form will now create a single model with all files if you're not just uploading archives (zipfiles), and it will confirm to you beforehand what will be created. You can set the model name at upload time, as well as the permissions using our new preset options introduced in the last release. If you upload archives only, it will still extract each one and create separate models. Hopefully this is the "least surprising" behaviour and we'd love to hear how you get on with it.

We've also done a load of UI work on making all the forms in the app more consistent and more visually appealing. They're not so messy now, and so hopefully easier to navigate. And ALSO, thanks to @macdylan, we've got a brand new Chinese (zh-CN) translation moving out of "experimental" phase into proper release!
