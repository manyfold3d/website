title: Release v0.110.0
date: 2025-05-19 11:16:31 UTC
---
Because of some medical issues (don't get old, folks), it's been an unusually long time between releases. But, that just means that this is a big one! And oh boy, it's a big one.

### Downloads

First off, we've got improvements to downloads; you now get a visual hint that your download zipfile will need to be created, and when you click, it'll update the button state when it's ready. There are also options for site admins to proactively create ZIP downloads and set how long they're kept; if you're running a site with lots of downloading, you might want them instantly available, at the cost of disk space of course!

### Faster page loading

Next, we've got some new client-side technology that enables the live updates; using [Hotwire](https://hotwired.dev), using your instance should now feel much faster, and act more like a client-side app. That also means that you'll see updates to models live as they happen; if you rescan, or upload some files, they'll appear in the page without you having to reload.

### New "original" rendering mode

Manyfold is seeing use not just in 3D printing, but in the game development world, and in that case, showing an untextured model isn't really right. Our new "original" rendering mode uses the textures and materials from the file itself, so complex formats like glTF, FBX, and more, will show the model as it really should look, while falling back to the usual preferences for models that don't have any of that stuff. This also comes with indexing of .bin files for glTF, and preview rendering for DRACO, FBX, and 3DS.

### GCODE previews

Rest assured we've not forgotten about print though; we've also added rendering for GCode files!

### Better search

Finally, there's a whole new search syntax, with powerful boolean operations, the ability to search specific fields, and more. Under the search box you'll see a new "search syntax" link, which will bring up a help box that explains it all. Search now also includes model descriptions and captions, and even filenames!
