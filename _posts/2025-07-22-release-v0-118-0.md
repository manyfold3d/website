A big new feature this time out: external site synchronisation! Now you can link your local models to their pages on Thingiverse, Cults3D and MyMiniFactory and automatically import metadata and images; and for Thingiverse, we can even sync 3d files!

This lets you easily add better data to your model, and easily keep it up to date. Even cooler, you can now just paste an external URL into the search bar, and if Manyfold understands it, it will automatically create a new model and import everything it can! 

This is manually-triggered for now, but we'll be adding automation and scheduling in future so your library can stay permanently up to date. Check out the [user guide](https://manyfold.app/manual/integrations.html) for more details!
