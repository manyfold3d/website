This release is all about improving accessibility after a recent audit. No new features as such, but if you're a screen reader or keyboard user you should find the site much easier to use. We now have skip links for large content blocks, proper tab ordering, better labels for links and buttons, and much more. We now use shape as well as colour to differentiate problem severity icons, which should help users with reduced colour vision.
