This release continues our work on (experimental!) federated search, using the system proposed by the [Fediscovery](https://fediscovery.org) project.

If you've got federation enabled, you can optionally sign up with Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers (FASPs), which are servers that can provide things like cross-instance search, account recommendations, and other services in future. We've integrated data sharing, follow recommendations and search into this latest version.

To try it out, hook up to our experimental FASP at `search.3dprint.social`, then visit `\follows` on your instance. At that point you should be able to find content from other servers just by typing plain text into the search box. As we test this out a bit more in the real world, we'll make it more tightly integrated into the main search process.

Note: Privacy and control are #1 priorities, and so only public content that's also set as "indexable" will be shared with the FASP and made available in results. You're always in full control.
