This release sees quite a milestone; it's the first time we've _removed_ a feature! You used to be able to choose how unrelated tags were shown in the cloud; either in a faded colour, or hidden completely and just shown as a count. In the process of fixing a performance problem with really big libraries, we decided that flexibility wasn't worth it for the amount of computation it required, so it's gone away. 

Despite listing it as a "breaking change", it's not a compatibility problem; you shouldn't notice any change unless you were using the faded colour option (which wasn't the default anyway). Hopefully though, you *will* notice a performance improvement in model lists because of the rewriting we've been able to do around tags.

Obviously, if that feature was the best thing ever and you want it back, then [open a ticket](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/new/choose) and we'll see if we can reintroduce it in a more efficient way.
