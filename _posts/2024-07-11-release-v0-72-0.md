title: Release v0.72.0
date: 2024-07-11 12:08:03 UTC
---
This release focuses on the deployment and sysadmin aspects of running Manyfold. We've added in support for MySQL / MariaDB database servers, as well as the ability to use SQLite's file-based database if you don't want to run a separate database server.

And at long last, by using SQLite, we've created a new "solo" image, which by default integrates everything into a single container - no need for a separate database or Redis server at all! Just pull `manyfold-solo` instead of `manyfold`, mount a persistent volume at `/config` for the database, and you're up and running!

Bonus feature: we've also cut the size of the docker image down, from 1.5GB to around 250MB, by removing all the build-time stuff that wasn't needed at runtime.
