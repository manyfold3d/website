This release brings the ability to rename files, finally! You can rename individually or in bulk, and the file list inside a model now takes subdirectory paths into account in its groupings, so you can really get organised! 

We also now index archive files, Prusa binary GCode, and HTML & Word documents. And on top of *all that*, we've had some great community contributions, like password strength settings, bulk updating models across all pages, and amazinglty, a _complete_ translation into Dutch!
