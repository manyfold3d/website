This post is a self-assessment of Manyfold against the [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) version 1.0 (Seventh Draft), carried out by [James Smith](https://floppy.org.uk) on 2024-07-12.

WSG is a new set of draft recommendations for the sustainability of websites, intending to play a similar role to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for accessibility. As part of Manyfold's funding from NLNet / NGI Zero, I proposed doing a WSG audit alongside our security and accessibility audits.

## Methodology

There isn't a formal grading process for WSG yet, so I'm taking a simple a red / amber / green approach, as follows:

* Red / Bad : This is definitely a problem, or we've not considered it.
* Amber / OK : We're partway there, but there's plenty to improve.
* Green / Good : We've got this pretty well covered (although there's always more to do).

At this point, I am not assessing against section 5 of the recommendations, which covers Business Strategy and Product Management; it's not really appropriate for this project. There are also plenty of parts of sections 2, 3 and 4 which aren't relevant either; those are included here but marked as  "not assessed".

Each assessment criterion will have a RAG grade, and some textual detail of the assessment. Numerical details will be included where possible.

## 2. User-Experience Design

### 2.1. [Undertake Systemic Impacts Mapping](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#undertake-systemic-impacts-mapping)

Many variables can impact the user-experience, and a bunch of these can impact how sustainable your website will be. Attempting to identify where you can make a difference to the visitor and give them a more sustainable experience will be beneficial.

#### External Variables

List the negative external variables and identify where your product's sustainable impact can be diminished (systemic design).

Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.2. [Assess and Research Visitor Needs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#assess-and-research-visitor-needs)

When creating a product or service, identifying your target audience through user-research, analytics, data collected using ethical anonymous methods, or feedback from and with visitors is important in being able to create a customized service for and with them that is tailor-made for their specific preferences, adapted for any needs they may have, and particularly useful in helping a website or application evolve its service to meet sustainability targets.

#### Identify And Define

Primary and secondary target visitors are identified, and their needs are defined through quantitative or qualitative research, testing, or analytics, ensuring your visitors and affected communities remain a close part of the research and testing process.

Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Visitor Constraints

Potential visitor constraints like the device age, operating system version, browser, and connection speeds are considered when designing user-experiences.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Barriers And Access

The team has researched and identified whether a technical, material, or human constraint might require an adapted version of the product or service that reduces barriers or improves access to content.

{:.ok}
We've not researched this with users, but we have done an accessibility audit and made changes to improve accessibility of the application. That's not the same as finding out what users *actually need* up front, but it's probably the best we can do for this sort of project.

#### Barrier Removal

In the user-research, identify with your visitors if some barriers should be removed (pain points or dark / deceptive design patterns).

{:.bad}
We've not been able to do direct user research yet.

#### Seat At The Table

When undertaking research, identifying needs, or conducting iterative design work, ensure that all stakeholders including your visitors have an equitable role in the decision-making process.

{:.ok}
As an open source project run solely over the web, the "seat at the table" is in theory open to all equally. We acknowledge that that's not always true though, and have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=coc-ov-file) as a way to hopefully show that we are a safe space for all contributors. We know there's more we can and should do.

### 2.3. [Research Non-Visitor's Needs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#research-non-visitor-s-needs)

If you provide physical goods or services, you may also have to account for the sustainability impact of delivery services. This can often be tricky, but courier companies may provide useful tooling to help you identify emissions data for routing.

#### Non-Human Impact

Consider and work with non-users and other stakeholders who might be passively impacted by a digital product or service, such as neighbors accepting parcels, traffic jams due to deliveries, etc. Research their needs and understand how they might be affected.

{:.not-assessed}
No physical product involved.

### 2.4. [Consider Sustainability in Early Ideation](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#consider-sustainability-in-early-ideation)

While some things require the use of electricity, during the early ideation phase you could consider wireframing or rapid prototyping (using paper) among other offline tools to reduce energy consumption. Even the electronic versions of these may have a lower carbon cost than committing to building a full-blown experience for each idea.

#### Wireframes And Prototypes

Utilize wireframes, and rapid prototyping to quickly build consensus, reduce risk, and lower the number of resources needed to build features.

{:.not-assessed}

Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Participation And Testing

Involve your users within the iteration and design process using participatory design, and when conducting user-testing reach out to your community to help improve your product by allowing them to apply their knowledge and experience to your product or service.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.5. [Account for Stakeholder Issues](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#account-for-stakeholder-issues)

Brainstorming allows you to flush out ideas before you commit to pursuing a path. Being considerate of not just your visitors but other individuals who may be affected by your product or service (including non-humans, like the environment!) is a useful practical exercise as it may influence your decisions in how you scope your project.

#### Human-Centered Brainstorming

In the brainstorming process, consider all stakeholders using a human-centered approach.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Ecological Brainstorming

In the brainstorming process, take the planetary needs and ecological boundaries into account.

Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.6. [Create a Lightweight Experience by Default](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#create-a-lightweight-experience-by-default)

When providing the option to download, save, print, or access anything online, defaulting to the most lightweight, least featureful version will reduce emissions through passive browsing; with non-essential information removed from the screen either to be shown when it's required or eliminated.

#### Efficient Paths

The path taken to access the service (the initial contact with the website or service) should be as efficient and as simple as possible (time required to complete an action displayed, reducing too much choice, ensuring visitors know what's required at the start of a complex set of steps, etc).

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Patterns For Efficiency

Make your user-journey (when browsing an accessed website or service) as smooth as possible. User-research is key, as is building on established design patterns that people already understand.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Distraction-Free Design

Visitors can complete tasks without distractions or non-essential features getting in the way.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Eliminate The Non-Essential

Visitors see only information that is relevant to their experience, without non-essential information being displayed on the screen.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### User-Initiated Actionable Content

Ensure that actionable information such as pop-up or modal windows can only be initiated by the visitor.

{:.good}
Actionable elements are only displayed in response to direct user input.

### 2.7. [Avoid Unnecessary or an Overabundance of Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-unnecessary-or-an-overabundance-of-assets)

It's great to have a pretty-looking website or application but to ensure a sustainable design, it's important to avoid cluttering up the interface with too many visuals (which aren't necessary to the content). Keeping a clean design will reduce website rendering, and thereby emissions.

#### Decorative Design

Decorative design is used only when it improves the user-experience, and unnecessary assets or ones that fail to benefit the visitor or sustainability are removed (or rendered optional and disabled by default).

{:.good}
Manyfold's design is kept as clean and simple as possible, with as few assets as possible. The only decorative elements used are small icons from the [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) set; everything else is functional.

### 2.8. [Ensure Navigation and Way-Finding Are Well-Structured](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#ensure-navigation-and-way-finding-are-well-structured)

Information architecture is a central part of the Web development process, and how you structure a website ensures that people can way-find your content easily. Having appropriately marked-up links within your product or service allows visitors, search engines, and social networks to identify key information quickly.

#### Navigation And Search

Provide an accessible, easy-to-use navigation menu with search features that help visitors easily find what they need.

{:.ok}
A primary purpose of the application is information management and organisation, so this is a primary focus for us. The navigation is reasonably clear; however, we know there are areas that need to be improved, particularly in terms of search results.

#### Navigable Sitemaps

Implementing an efficient (human-readable) sitemap that is organized and regularly updated helps search engines better index website content, which helps visitors more quickly find what they are looking for.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### New Content

Provide a way for visitors to find out about new content and services.

{:.good}
The main user dashboard page provides a list of recently uploaded content.

### 2.9. [Respect the Visitor's Attention](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#respect-the-visitor-s-attention)

Time is precious, wasting a visitor's will cause frustration and lead to abandonment or resentment. Additionally, the more time a visitor spends in front of a screen, the more energy they utilize. As such, throwing stuff in front of the visitor vying for their attention might sound like good business (even though we know due to banner blindness it rarely works), but it mostly damages the environment and dissuades the visitor.

#### Respecting Attention

Respect a visitor's attention by allowing them to easily control how (and when) they receive information.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Avoid Distraction

Prioritize features that don't distract people or unnecessarily lengthen the time they spend using the product or service.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Avoid Attention-keeping

Avoid using infinite scroll or related attention-keeping tactics.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.10. [Use Recognized Design Patterns](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-recognized-design-patterns)

Visitors can identify patterns fairly easily, and they like browsing websites and apps and feeling as if they know what they are dealing with. As such, focusing your efforts on producing a product or service that is clean and has key components in easy-to-recognize locations (and visuals) will allow faster user-experiences and fewer emissions.

#### Design Patterns

Provide only essential components visible at the time they are needed. Where appropriate, interfaces should deploy visual styles (patterns) that are easily recognized and used.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.11. [Avoid Manipulative Patterns](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-manipulative-patterns)

Manipulating the visitor into doing things you want them to is a short-term gain, long-term loss tactic tool. It's ethically bad, unsustainable, and should be avoided at all costs.

#### Dark and Deceptive Design Patterns

Avoid what are commonly known as dark patterns, deceptive design, or unethical coding techniques, which manipulate visitors into taking actions not necessarily in their best interest (anti-right click, no-copy, requiring an account to purchase, etc).

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Using Advertisements

Advertisements and sponsorships are both ethical and clearly identified with the product or service, only presenting them when they provide real economic and ethical value and don't diminish a visitor's experience.

{:.good}
We have no advertising.

#### Page Tracking

Remove unused and unconsented page tracking.

{:.good}
Manyfold itself has no page tracking, or any way to add it in short of changing the code. The Manyfold website uses [Umami](https://umami.is) privacy-preserving analytics to measure visits.

#### Search Engine Optimization

Optimization for search engines, social networks, and third-party services should be organically led with good coding practices and user-experience being the focus, not manipulating the services to gain greater priority through obfuscating content, pages, websites, or applications with redundancy or non-useful and optimized (to the visitor) material.

{:.good}
Manyfold uses well-structured semantic HTML; any search engine ranking obtained thereby is purely as a result of the content being useful.

### 2.12. [Document and Share Project Outputs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#document-and-share-project-outputs)

Everything produced by designers, developers, writers, and those involved with a project should be in an open format, well maintained, and curated in a common format (so everyone is working from the same model).

#### Deliverables Reusability

The deliverables output, including documentation, are used upstream of the project and produced in ways that will allow it to be reused in subsequent projects.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Deliverables Documentation

Design functionality and technical specifications are documented so that deliverables are comprehensible by the project team and transferable to the development team.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Deliverables Readability

Ensure that developers have access to code comments and other View Source affordances which can reduce the burden to access, understand, maintain, and utilize production-ready code as this will reduce redundancy and foster an open source culture.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.13. [Use a Design System To Prioritize Interface Consistency](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-a-design-system-to-prioritize-interface-consistency)

Design systems allow common components and patterns to be formalized and managed within a website or application. By using such a tool, designers and developers can avoid reinventing existing tooling and thereby reduce wasted time (and emissions).

#### Design System

Employ a design system based on web standards and recognizable patterns to mutualize interface components and provide a consistent experience for visitors.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.14. [Write With Purpose, in an Accessible, Easy To Understand Format](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#write-with-purpose-in-an-accessible-easy-to-understand-format)

Everyone should be able to understand what you've written without wasting time staring at a screen or jumping from page to page looking for answers, whether they have accessibility requirements or not. This also means avoiding using technical language (without explanations) and including enough information to help direct people (and search engines) from page to page.

#### Write Clearly

Write clearly, using plain, inclusive language delivered at an easy-to-understand reading level considering accessibility and internationalization inclusions as required (for example, dyslexia).

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Content Formatting

Deliver content formatted in ways that support how people read online, including a clear document structure, visual hierarchy, headings, bulleted lists, line spacing, and so on.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Prioritize SEO at early design stages and throughout a product or service's lifecycle to improve content findability.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.15. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Image Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-image-assets)

Of all the data that comprises the largest over-the-wire transfer rates within the average website or application, images are usually those that are responsible due to their quantity and usefulness. As such, doing all you can to reduce their size and unnecessary loading will be beneficial for sustainability.

#### Need For Images

Assess the need for images considering the quantity, format, and size necessary for implementation.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Optimize Images

Resize, optimize, and compress each image (outside the browser), offering different sizes (for each image) for different screen resolutions.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Lazy Loading

Provide Lazy Loading to ensure image assets only load when they are required.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Sizing And Deactivation

Let the visitor select the display size, and provide the option to deactivate images.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Management And Usage

Set up a media management and use policy to reduce the overall impact of images, with criteria for media compression and file formats.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.16. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Media Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-media-assets)

Video and audio-heavy websites are often those that can have significant sustainability costs in terms of storage and carbon intensity for viewers who have to process the media with their devices to watch them (draining batteries). Optimizing such assets as much as possible is critical for a sustainable product or service.

#### Need For Media

Assess the need for video or sound usage (including only when they add visitor value), and ban non-informative media (background media) including autoplaying functionality.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Optimize Media

Choose the right media to display by compressing according to the visitor's requirements, selecting the appropriate format, ensuring it works across browsers, and avoiding embedded player plugins.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Lazy Loading

Media requiring a lot of data to be downloaded on the client side (including the media itself) must be loaded via a facade (a non-functional, static, representational element).

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Labels And Choice

Increase visitor awareness and control by informing them of the length, format, and weight of the media; allowing media deactivation, and giving a choice of resolutions; all while providing alternative resolutions and formats.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Management And Usage

Set up a media management and use policy to reduce the overall impact of audio and video, with criteria for media compression and file formats.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.17. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Animation](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-animation)

Animation can be both CPU and GPU-intensive and have implications for accessibility. While visually appealing and useful in certain situations, care and attention should be taken when considering the use of a high emissions technology.

#### Need For Animation

Use animation only when it adds value to a visitor's experience, and not for decorative elements.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Avoid Overburdening

Progressively display an appropriate quantity of animation so as not to overburden the visitor or diminish expected device behavior.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Control Animation

Allow visitors to start, stop, pause, or otherwise control animated content.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.18. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Typefaces](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-typefaces)

Since the advent of the modern web, the ability to include embedded fonts and provide a more customized experience has seen their use explode. They aren't always the most performant option (which poses emissions hazards) and come with a few issues such as Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC) / Flash Of Unstyled Text (FOUT) which should be addressed.

#### Default Typefaces

Use standard system-level (web-safe / pre-installed) fonts as much as possible.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Font Optimization

Ensure the number of fonts, and the variants within typefaces (such as weight and characters) are limited within a project, using the most performant file format available.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.19. [Provide Suitable Alternatives to Web Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#provide-suitable-alternatives-to-web-assets)

Media, images, fonts, and documents enrich the Internet. The problem is that people may not want to watch a video, listen to an audio file, look at an image, or use a specific application. By providing alternative formats to anything you embed, you ensure the widest possible audience can benefit from it (and reduced carbon output will occur as the alternative text will induce less consumer hardware thrashing than its rich media alternative).

#### Open Formats

All proprietary file formats (such as PDF) should also be offered in HTML for accessibility and to ensure future availability.

{:.good}
We do not use any proprietary formats in our own work. The system can be used to index and manage files in proprietary formats, but that is beyond the scope of assessment.

#### Font Subsetting

All custom typefaces (using font-display) should be subsetted and offered as part of a font stack with a system font as a backup.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Alternative Text

All images should provide meaningful alternative text for screen reader users (or when images fail to load) accessibility.

#### Audio Alternatives

Audio should provide text transcripts of conversations as an alternative to playing the media.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Video Alternatives

Video should provide text transcripts (at minimum), subtitles (using WebVTT), and for accessibility best practice, offer closed captions and sign language options.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

### 2.20. [Provide Accessible, Usable, Minimal Web Forms](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#provide-accessible-usable-minimal-web-forms)

Understandably, businesses want to know more about their customers, but a key part of sustainability is being ethical towards visitors and as such, the right to privacy is considered paramount. Don't demand information when it's not required and not only will this help visitors complete transactions quicker (reducing emissions), it will help with legal compliance such as GDPR.

#### Form Simplicity

Assess the need for forms and reduce form content to the bare minimum necessary to meet the visitor's needs and the organization's business goals. Clearly communicate why a form is necessary, what its value proposition is, how many steps it will take to complete, and what an organization will do with collected data (informed consent).

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Form Functionality

Avoid auto-completion / auto-suggest if it would prove unhelpful (to conserve bandwidth) whilst allowing autofill for ease of repeat entry (including the use of helpful tooling such as password managers).

### 2.21. [Support Non-Graphic Ways To Interact With Content](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#support-non-graphic-ways-to-interact-with-content)

Certain visitors such as those with visual disabilities or speech agents (like Amazon Alexa) may rely on an experience without the graphical part of an interface. As such, they potentially may use less data or may have a different carbon impact on the Web.

#### Alternative Interactions

Support speech browsing and other non-graphical ways to interact with content that provide alternatives to a visual interface.

### 2.22. [Provide Useful Notifications To Improve The Visitor's Journey](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#give-useful-notifications-to-improve-the-visitor-s-journey)

Notifications whether through the browser or messaging can be potentially useful, but only used in moderation. Spam and the lack of control are contributing sources of Internet emissions and as such, businesses should aim to reduce such actions.

#### Notification Justification

Remove non-essential notifications while justifying and reducing the practice of e-mailing or text messaging to what is strictly necessary. Useful notifications (such as alerts for new content) should be used with care and restraint.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Notification Control

Let the visitor control notifications (for example through the browser, SMS, or by email) and adjust messaging preferences, and the option to unsubscribe, logout, and close an account should be available and visible.

### 2.23. [Reduce the Impact of Downloadable or Physical Documents](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#reduce-the-impact-of-downloadable-or-physical-documents)

Printing or downloading documents can both be a net benefit and a net cost in terms of sustainability as it can reduce repeat requests to websites, but the act of printing (especially when unoptimized) wastes valuable ink and paper.

#### Printing Documents

Design documents to limit the printing impact. If the production of paper documents is essential, it should be designed to limit its impact to the lowest possible. Create a CSS Print stylesheet and test it with different types of content. Ensure PDF printing is encouraged over paper-based storage.

{:.not-assessed}

#### Optimize Delivery

If a document is likely to be re-used, generate the document once on the server-side (preferably on a cookie-free domain) rather than forcing the effort to be duplicated.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Labels And Choice

Clearly display the document name, a summary, the file size, and the format, allowing the visitor a choice if possible of both the format, and the language (if not the same as the web page). Furthermore, be sure to avoid embedding the document within Web pages (provide a direct link to download or view within the browser instead).

### 2.24. [Create a Stakeholder-Focused Testing & Prototyping Policy](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#create-a-stakeholder-focused-testing-prototyping-policy)

The organization has policies and practices in place to incorporate stakeholder-focused testing and prototyping into its product development cycles.

#### New Features And Perspectives

The organization has outlined processes it uses to prototype and test new features, product ideas, and user-interface components when applicable with real users who represent various stakeholder perspectives, including people with slow connection, with disabilities, with difficulties using digital services, and so on.

### 2.25. [Conduct Regular Audits, Regression, and Non-Regression Tests](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#conduct-regular-audits-regression-and-non-regression-tests)

Products and services at any stage of a project can suffer bugs or issues that need to be resolved. Fixing these regressions also generates additional development and environmental costs. By resolving such issues, you can reduce the chances of a visitor giving up on a session and thereby reduce the amount of wasted energy your website emits overall.

#### Regular Issue Testing

Check your codebase for bugs, identify any performance issues, and account for accessibility or security problems at either monthly or quarterly timeframes (depending on your scheduling allowance).

### 2.29. [Incorporate Compatibility Testing Into Each Release-Cycle](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#incorporate-compatibility-testing-into-each-release-cycle)

Compatibility is a critical part of the sustainability mindset and should be prioritized through all products and services. If individuals wish to use older devices (or cannot upgrade due to cost) or do not wish to upgrade as frequently, it will reduce the amount of e-waste that enters the system. If something doesn't work, it's also likely to result in visitors suffering a wasted effort, potentially leading to refused access to your service (and thereby emitting further emissions).

#### Compatibility Policy

Establish a policy for compatibility with obsolete devices and software versions, listing the supported devices brands, operating systems, and browsers (including versions).

## 3. Web Development

### 3.1. [Identify Relevant Technical Indicators](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#identify-relevant-technical-indicators)

Performance is a key part of the sustainability mindset as reductions in loading times can have a considerable impact on energy loads within CPU, GPU, RAM, and hard drive caching (among other variables), as such ensuring a performant product is essential.

#### Performance Goals

Set goals that impact the environment and performance of the service, for example, HTTP requests, or the amount of DOM elements that need to be rendered.

{:.not-assessed}
TODO: Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", or "good" to set the evaluation overall result.

#### Accountancy Types

Because the payload being delivered may not always be equal in terms of energy intensity, operators of websites and applications must ensure that consideration is given for the energy intensity (or unit being evaluated) of each component. For example, non-rendering text is less computational than CSS, which in turn is less process-heavy than JavaScript, which is less resource-heavy than WebGL.

### 3.2. [Minify Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#minify-your-html-css-and-javascript)

Whitespace holds no value when it's being presented to the visitor (unless they view the source code), by using minification, valuable data savings can be made which will reduce loading times.

#### Minify Code

All source code is minified upon compilation (including inline code).

### 3.3. [Use Code-Splitting Within Projects](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-code-splitting-within-projects)

When dealing with heavy components (such as JavaScript), the ability to modularize them into smaller pieces that can be loaded as and when required reduces the amount of redundancy and serves as a great way to make your scripts more sustainable.

#### Code Splitting

### 3.5. [Ensure Your Solutions Are Accessible](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#ensure-your-solutions-are-accessible)

Not everyone can access services equally, being sustainable is also about being accessible, fair, ethical, and ensuring that your product or service doesn't discriminate. As such, ensuring your website complies with best practices and relevant laws whilst meeting the needs of your visitors is critical as well as good business.

#### Accessibility Compliance

Your website or application must conform to WCAG (at the necessary level), plus extend beyond to obey relevant laws and meet additional visitor accessibility requirements. Building inclusively means that people with permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities will be able to more quickly find what they are looking for, and not have to spend extra time searching for a way to use your product or service.

### 3.6. [Avoid Code Duplication](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-code-duplication)

Redundancy is the enemy of sustainability. Having systems in place to ensure that everyone can work from established patterns, the website or application remains clean and easy to use, and iteration over redesign is firmly in the mindset that will help promote sustainable practices. It's also worth being wary of abstracting code too early (see AHA methodology) or incorrectly, as while good abstractions can be more efficient, poor ones can waste effort and introduce complexity, bloat, and bugs to your codebase which can lead to emissions.

#### Remove Or Simplify

Don't be afraid to remove or simplify (through rewriting for performance) your code to focus on essential features and have a cleaner, less redundant product (and codebase).

### 3.7. [Rigorously Assess Third-Party Services](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#rigorously-assess-third-party-services)

Whether advertising, chatbots, maps, or other tooling; outsourcing your service to a third-party provider may be potentially useful in certain scenarios in reducing design or development time and redundancy (which can be a win for sustainability). Third-party services, however, come with issues, such as the lack of control over emissions, and they often can potentially suffer from latency and large file sizes which may not exist if you self-hosted or created the material.

#### Assess Third-Parties

Assess third-party services (including plugins, widgets, feeds, maps, carousels, etc) as early in the ideation or creation process as possible and use as few as possible to reduce the product or service's overall ecological impact, including Scope 3 emissions.

#### Third-party Preferences

Third-party products, services, libraries, and frameworks are often a source of sustainability issues that cannot be controlled or managed by the first-party provider of a service. While many do provide benefits to a website, the need to justify their inclusion should be made not only by those creating the product or service but also be able to be controlled by the consumer. As showcased with cookies, websites or applications should provide a similar mechanism of disabling or refusing non-first-party features (with explanations of their purpose) - unless such features can be proven as critical for functionality.

### 3.13. [Adapt to User Preferences](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#adapt-to-user-preferences)

Sustainability benefits can be generated in numerous ways, by making sure that your website adheres to the requests made by a browser for specific conditions to be taken into account (such as CSS media and preference queries), you can unlock benefits for the visitor, and as a by-product reduce your emissions. It's worth noting that the introduction of user preferences and APIs has increased the risk of visitor fingerprinting and privacy issues.

#### Media and Preference Queries

Apply the monochrome, prefers-contrast, prefers-color-scheme, prefers-reduced-data, prefers-reduced-transparency, and prefers-reduced-motion CSS preference queries if they will benefit your website or application. Also, consider the print & scripting CSS media queries if they will improve the sustainability of your website.

### 3.14. [Develop a Mobile-First Layout](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#develop-a-mobile-first-layout)

Visitors approach our products and services on a wide variety of devices these days. Ensuring that your device works on the widest range of devices and differing screen resolutions ensures that you will have a compatible website or application. As such, visitors can actively choose to browse on devices that emit less carbon if they wish.

#### Mobile-First

Allow a website or app to work on mobile devices primarily (testing with various connection speeds), expanding to accommodate larger displays thereafter (mobile-first). It is much more effective to do the hard work to ensure that it works well on a mobile device and then scale it up to larger interfaces.

While JavaScript may not cause the most website bloat, it can cause very high emissions in terms of CPU load due to the rendering process, thereby it makes sense to consider the use of dependencies and third-party code carefully.

#### Dependency Management

Prevent developers from downloading and installing JavaScript libraries to run locally (client-side) when they are not needed by checking for unused dependencies and uninstalling those that aren't needed and removing them from your package.json file.

The Web is full of dead, often proprietary code, created using standards that have been superseded or by groups that aren't recognized. By following recognized coding standards, you ensure that your code will be rendered properly by browsers (and reduce the potential for added emissions occurring from unmaintained rendering processes).

#### Deprecated Code

### 3.21. [Align Technical Requirements With Sustainability Goals](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#align-technical-requirements-with-sustainability-goals)

Every product or service is different, and each will require a different set of tooling to accomplish the most sustainable result. Deciding whether to go with a bulky framework, Static Site Generator (SSG), or a Content Management System (CMS) takes careful planning based on client or service requirements.

#### Identify Requirements

List (and choose carefully) the requirements of the product or service. A simpler technological implementation may use more human resources but could have a smaller footprint. A prebuilt solution may use more system resources (and thereby produce more emissions upon render) but have a faster build-time (emitting less carbon during development).

#### Optimized Methodology

As a general rule, coding from scratch is the best-performing methodology (though if an existing solution is actively maintained, it may be better optimized than what you could produce). Therefore, prefer native components and file systems to a WYSIWYG editor or heavy framework, and be considerate of the impact of third-party solutions.

#### Static VS Dynamic

If you do decide to use a code generation tool, consider using a Static Site Generator in preference to a bulky content management system. Because SSGs often start using a minimalist content entry format (like markdown) and all of the compilation is done before the website is uploaded, the emissions benefit comes from the server not having to place as much effort into serving pages (as they are static) for each visitor. In the case of a CMS, the dynamic nature of a site will involve additional computation (server-side processing) and bulkier libraries.

### 3.24. [Run Fewer, Simpler Queries As Possible](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#run-fewer-simpler-queries-as-possible)

Making multiple requests whether HTTP or within a database has a carbon cost as infrastructure has to send that information back and forth. As such, managing how you store and use data locally for a visitor will help reduce wasted cycles.

#### Database Queries

If you need information that is stored in a database, and you require it (or it's likely to be requested) more than once in your code, access the database only once, and store the data locally for subsequent processing. Also, avoid reliance on framework helpers that might defer filtering to later on in the process.

## 4. Hosting, Infrastructure And Systems

### 4.1. [Choose a Sustainable Hosting Provider](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#choose-a-sustainable-hosting-provider)

In addition to reducing the environmental impacts of a website, choose a hosting service that mitigates the remaining impacts. To make sure of this, there are many criteria to look for.

#### Monitor Metrics

To assess the environmental impacts of hosting and detect overconsumption, some indicators should be monitored: energy / water usage, CPU / Memory usage, allocation of servers and CPU cores, etc. These indicators could be used to calculate metrics directly related to environmental impacts, such as Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE), Water Usage Effectiveness (WUE), and Carbon Usage Effectiveness (CUE). They could be displayed to visitors for transparency and monitoring reasons.

#### Renewable Electricity

Electricity comes entirely from sources with the lowest possible carbon intensity (ideally generated by wind or solar rather than from non-renewable sources). For example, Renewable Energy Credits (RECs) can help verify the source, or, ideally, prove that electricity comes directly from renewable sources.

#### Remaining Emissions

Compensate remaining emissions, keeping in mind that the priority should be to avoid then reduce them and only compensate for them if they cannot be avoided. Carbon credits may not be sustainable, therefore the effectiveness of an offset solution must be verified, shown to be both environmentally viable and sustainable, and part of a longer-term strategy to eliminate emissions entirely from a chain, benefitting the wider ecosystem.

### 4.2. [Optimize Browser Caching](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#optimize-browser-caching)

Browser caching reduces the requirement for files to need to be constantly reloaded from the server, and in certain situations, it can even allow for files to be viewed offline (or in the case of a reverse proxy, send immediate recurring requests without additional calculation or computation from the server). As such, this will have sustainability and performance benefits (for instance by greatly reducing Time-To-First-Byte).

#### Server-side Caching

If using a CMS, install an applicable plugin to enable on-the-fly server-side caching. Otherwise, use the provided server configuration files to include and tweak the file-type cache expiration using expires, bfcache, or cache-control HTTP header. If using a language or framework that generates pages on request, cache responses for static pages so that they can be reused for future visitors.

#### Offline Access

Client-side JavaScript uses a combination of ServiceWorkers, WebWorkers, storage Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), or cookies (if necessary) to streamline the user-journey. For example, through the use of a PWA (Progressive Web Application) to ensure that an offline version is available and accessible at all times to reduce inequality and improve accessibility.

### 4.3. [Compress Your Files](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#compress-your-files)

Every file will take up a certain amount of room on a server's hard drive, and this data will need to be sent across the wire to each visitor. Doing so will consume resources, but by using compression algorithms you can shrink each file to make its journey less impactful.

#### Server-side Compression

If using a CMS, install an applicable plugin to enable on-the-fly server-side compression, such as Brotli or GZIP. Otherwise, use the provided server configuration files to include and tweak the performance-related features to the requirements.

### 4.4. [Use Error Pages and Redirects Carefully](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-error-pages-and-redirects-carefully)

Navigation errors lead to mistakes, which lead to visitors wasting time trying to resolve them, or abandoning a website altogether. Anything that can be done to interject, predict, and way-find around potential problems will reduce emissions over time.

#### Error Pages

Maintain sites by ensuring links are correct, and if errors occur, provide suitable way-finding within optimized pages for each error type to ensure resources can be identified to help visitors complete the task they started.

### 4.6. [Automate To Fit the Needs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#automate-to-fit-the-needs)

Any tasks, especially repetitive, that can be automated should be automated (compilation, deployment, tests, etc.) to reduce time at the computer being wasted by people.

#### Automate Tasks

Every recurring task, such as deployment, testing, or compilation, can be run automatically, as recommended by continuous integration / continuous delivery best practices.

#### Security Tooling

Web browsing from bots has been steadily increasing in recent years. As such, it is a growing concern for security, performance, and sustainability. Use security tools that automatically block bad actors and minimize bad behavior. This results in substantially less load on the server, fewer logs, less data, less effect due to compromise, and more. The result of compromised websites is a large increase in HTTP, email, and other traffic as malicious code attempts to infiltrate other resources and exfiltrate data. Compromised websites are typically identified by anomalous patterned behavior.

### 4.7. [Maintain a Relevant Refresh Frequency](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#maintain-a-relevant-refresh-frequency)

Only send data from the server when the visitor needs it. As much as possible, you can rely on client-side or server-side cache and client-side / local storage. Rather than refreshing data on a given frequency, it might be up to the visitor to manually ask for a refresh.

#### Refresh Frequency

The frequency for refresh (of both the cache, locally stored data, and the page) is defined depending on visitor needs.

### 4.8. [Be Mindful of Duplicate Data](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#be-mindful-of-duplicate-data)

For security reasons and in accordance with a Service-Level Agreement (SLA), it is often recommended to duplicate data to make sure it remains available if a problem occurs. This should be balanced with the cost of such duplication. Not all data is critical and, rather than overcompensating with multiple saves, duplication should be designed with efficiency in mind.

#### Data Backups

Backups of system and user data are both incremental and secure.

### 4.9. [Enable Asynchronous Processing and Communication](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#enable-asynchronous-processing-and-communication)

Depending on carbon intensity, some processes and communications should be delayed and sometimes batched. This could also be a way to reduce the workload on a server or Virtual Machine (VM). In such cases, visitors should be warned that the process is asynchronous and notified when it is over.

#### Batch Processing

By default, non-critical processes and communications are batched and launched only when carbon intensity is under a given threshold.

### 4.10. [Consider CDNs and Edge Caching](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#consider-cdn-s-and-edge-caching)

Edge caching and CDN delivery can help optimize the sustainable delivery of digital services by optimizing how your website's traffic is transferred over the internet.

#### Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)

When building for a globally distributed audience, use a CDN to store and serve simple read-only, pre-generated resources in a fast and efficient manner. Although they definitely can increase performance, it is also another layer of infrastructure that needs to be considered for sustainability.

#### Avoid Caching Inappropriate Resources

Avoid using the service to host dynamic resources or JavaScript (unless through a first-party host) as due to cache partitioning, cross-origin resource sharing (CORS), and other browser mechanics, any benefits are negated by weaker performance, the inability to cache or interact, and the potential introduction of security and privacy issues to be introduced.

#### Process Data Close to the Source

All information passed between the layers of an application incurs a cost, both in terms of data transferred, and CPU cycles for (de)serialization. Wherever possible, data transformations should be performed close to the source to reduce these costs and avoid processing data that will later be discarded.

Select infrastructure with minimal specifications meeting business requirements of performance, availability, etc.

#### Lowest Requirements

Select infrastructure elements with the lowest requirements tier, meeting your service-level agreements. Avoid over-provisioning multi-datacenter, multi-zone, or distributed deployments if standalone instances meet the requirements. Also avoid provisioning infrastructure that will be under-utilized by provisioning for established average loads, ensuring reasonable resource utilization and autoscaling occurs as needed. Avoid provisioning for peak loads.
