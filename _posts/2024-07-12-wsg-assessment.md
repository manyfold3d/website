This post is a self-assessment of Manyfold against the [Web Sustainability Guidelines](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/) version 1.0 (Seventh Draft), carried out by [James Smith](https://floppy.org.uk) on 2024-07-12.

WSG is a new set of draft recommendations for the sustainability of websites, intending to play a similar role to [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for accessibility. As part of Manyfold's funding from NLNet / NGI Zero, I proposed doing a WSG audit alongside our security and accessibility audits.

## Methodology

There isn't a formal grading process for WSG yet, so I'm taking a simple a red / amber / green approach, as follows:

* Red / Bad : This is definitely a problem, or we've not considered it.
* Amber / OK : We're partway there, but there's plenty to improve.
* Green / Good : We've got this pretty well covered (although there's always more to do).

At this point, I am not assessing against section 5 of the recommendations, which covers Business Strategy and Product Management; it's not really appropriate for this project. There are also plenty of parts of sections 2, 3 and 4 which aren't relevant either; those are included here but marked as  "not assessed".

Each assessment criterion will have a RAG grade, and some textual detail of the assessment. Numerical details will be included where possible.

## Conclusions

## Section 2. User-Experience Design

### Guideline 2.1. [Undertake Systemic Impacts Mapping](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#undertake-systemic-impacts-mapping)

Many variables can impact the user-experience, and a bunch of these can impact how sustainable your website will be. Attempting to identify where you can make a difference to the visitor and give them a more sustainable experience will be beneficial.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### External Variables

List the negative external variables and identify where your product's sustainable impact can be diminished (systemic design).

{:.bad}
We have not identified externalities in any useful way; there are the obvious ones around energy and bandwidth use, but this isn't done in an organised fashion.

</details>

### Guideline 2.2. [Assess and Research Visitor Needs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#assess-and-research-visitor-needs)

When creating a product or service, identifying your target audience through user-research, analytics, data collected using ethical anonymous methods, or feedback from and with visitors is important in being able to create a customized service for and with them that is tailor-made for their specific preferences, adapted for any needs they may have, and particularly useful in helping a website or application evolve its service to meet sustainability targets.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Identify And Define

Primary and secondary target visitors are identified, and their needs are defined through quantitative or qualitative research, testing, or analytics, ensuring your visitors and affected communities remain a close part of the research and testing process.

{:.bad}
The application is being developed through following our own instincts on what's useful, and listening to our community for their needs and feature requests. However, this is all very ad-hoc.

#### Visitor Constraints

Potential visitor constraints like the device age, operating system version, browser, and connection speeds are considered when designing user-experiences.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Barriers And Access

The team has researched and identified whether a technical, material, or human constraint might require an adapted version of the product or service that reduces barriers or improves access to content.

{:.ok}
We've not researched this with users, but we have done an accessibility audit and made changes to improve accessibility of the application. That's not the same as finding out what users *actually need* up front, but it's probably the best we can do for this sort of project.

#### Barrier Removal

In the user-research, identify with your visitors if some barriers should be removed (pain points or dark / deceptive design patterns).

{:.bad}
We've not been able to do direct user research yet.

#### Seat At The Table

When undertaking research, identifying needs, or conducting iterative design work, ensure that all stakeholders including your visitors have an equitable role in the decision-making process.

{:.ok}
As an open source project run solely over the web, the "seat at the table" is in theory open to all equally. We acknowledge that that's not always true though, and have adopted the [Contributor Covenant](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold?tab=coc-ov-file) as a way to hopefully show that we are a safe space for all contributors. We know there's more we can and should do.

</details>

### Guideline 2.3. [Research Non-Visitor's Needs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#research-non-visitor-s-needs)

If you provide physical goods or services, you may also have to account for the sustainability impact of delivery services. This can often be tricky, but courier companies may provide useful tooling to help you identify emissions data for routing.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Non-Human Impact

Consider and work with non-users and other stakeholders who might be passively impacted by a digital product or service, such as neighbors accepting parcels, traffic jams due to deliveries, etc. Research their needs and understand how they might be affected.

{:.na}
No physical product involved.

</details>

### Guideline 2.4. [Consider Sustainability in Early Ideation](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#consider-sustainability-in-early-ideation)

While some things require the use of electricity, during the early ideation phase you could consider wireframing or rapid prototyping (using paper) among other offline tools to reduce energy consumption. Even the electronic versions of these may have a lower carbon cost than committing to building a full-blown experience for each idea.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Wireframes And Prototypes

Utilize wireframes, and rapid prototyping to quickly build consensus, reduce risk, and lower the number of resources needed to build features.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Participation And Testing

Involve your users within the iteration and design process using participatory design, and when conducting user-testing reach out to your community to help improve your product by allowing them to apply their knowledge and experience to your product or service.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.5. [Account for Stakeholder Issues](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#account-for-stakeholder-issues)

Brainstorming allows you to flush out ideas before you commit to pursuing a path. Being considerate of not just your visitors but other individuals who may be affected by your product or service (including non-humans, like the environment!) is a useful practical exercise as it may influence your decisions in how you scope your project.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Human-Centered Brainstorming

In the brainstorming process, consider all stakeholders using a human-centered approach.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Ecological Brainstorming

In the brainstorming process, take the planetary needs and ecological boundaries into account.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.6. [Create a Lightweight Experience by Default](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#create-a-lightweight-experience-by-default)

When providing the option to download, save, print, or access anything online, defaulting to the most lightweight, least featureful version will reduce emissions through passive browsing; with non-essential information removed from the screen either to be shown when it's required or eliminated.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Efficient Paths

The path taken to access the service (the initial contact with the website or service) should be as efficient and as simple as possible (time required to complete an action displayed, reducing too much choice, ensuring visitors know what's required at the start of a complex set of steps, etc).

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Patterns For Efficiency

Make your user-journey (when browsing an accessed website or service) as smooth as possible. User-research is key, as is building on established design patterns that people already understand.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Distraction-Free Design

Visitors can complete tasks without distractions or non-essential features getting in the way.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Eliminate The Non-Essential

Visitors see only information that is relevant to their experience, without non-essential information being displayed on the screen.

{:.good}
We try to only display directly relevant information in the UI. There isn't anything coming from any source that's not directly related to what the user is doing.

#### User-Initiated Actionable Content

Ensure that actionable information such as pop-up or modal windows can only be initiated by the visitor.

{:.good}
Actionable elements are only displayed in response to direct user input.

</details>

### Guideline 2.7. [Avoid Unnecessary or an Overabundance of Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-unnecessary-or-an-overabundance-of-assets)

It's great to have a pretty-looking website or application but to ensure a sustainable design, it's important to avoid cluttering up the interface with too many visuals (which aren't necessary to the content). Keeping a clean design will reduce website rendering, and thereby emissions.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Decorative Design

Decorative design is used only when it improves the user-experience, and unnecessary assets or ones that fail to benefit the visitor or sustainability are removed (or rendered optional and disabled by default).

{:.good}
Manyfold's design is kept as clean and simple as possible, with as few assets as possible. The only decorative elements used are small icons from the [Bootstrap Icons](https://icons.getbootstrap.com/) set; everything else is functional.

</details>

### Guideline 2.8. [Ensure Navigation and Way-Finding Are Well-Structured](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#ensure-navigation-and-way-finding-are-well-structured)

Information architecture is a central part of the Web development process, and how you structure a website ensures that people can way-find your content easily. Having appropriately marked-up links within your product or service allows visitors, search engines, and social networks to identify key information quickly.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Navigation And Search

Provide an accessible, easy-to-use navigation menu with search features that help visitors easily find what they need.

{:.ok}
A primary purpose of the application is information management and organisation, so this is a primary focus for us. The navigation is reasonably clear; however, we know there are areas that need to be improved, particularly in terms of search results.

#### Navigable Sitemaps

Implementing an efficient (human-readable) sitemap that is organized and regularly updated helps search engines better index website content, which helps visitors more quickly find what they are looking for.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### New Content

Provide a way for visitors to find out about new content and services.

{:.good}
The main user dashboard page provides a list of recently uploaded content.

</details>

### Guideline 2.9. [Respect the Visitor's Attention](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#respect-the-visitor-s-attention)

Time is precious, wasting a visitor's will cause frustration and lead to abandonment or resentment. Additionally, the more time a visitor spends in front of a screen, the more energy they utilize. As such, throwing stuff in front of the visitor vying for their attention might sound like good business (even though we know due to banner blindness it rarely works), but it mostly damages the environment and dissuades the visitor.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Respecting Attention

Respect a visitor's attention by allowing them to easily control how (and when) they receive information.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Avoid Distraction

Prioritize features that don't distract people or unnecessarily lengthen the time they spend using the product or service.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Avoid Attention-keeping

Avoid using infinite scroll or related attention-keeping tactics.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.10. [Use Recognized Design Patterns](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-recognized-design-patterns)

Visitors can identify patterns fairly easily, and they like browsing websites and apps and feeling as if they know what they are dealing with. As such, focusing your efforts on producing a product or service that is clean and has key components in easy-to-recognize locations (and visuals) will allow faster user-experiences and fewer emissions.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Design Patterns

Provide only essential components visible at the time they are needed. Where appropriate, interfaces should deploy visual styles (patterns) that are easily recognized and used.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.11. [Avoid Manipulative Patterns](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-manipulative-patterns)

Manipulating the visitor into doing things you want them to is a short-term gain, long-term loss tactic tool. It's ethically bad, unsustainable, and should be avoided at all costs.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Dark and Deceptive Design Patterns

Avoid what are commonly known as dark patterns, deceptive design, or unethical coding techniques, which manipulate visitors into taking actions not necessarily in their best interest (anti-right click, no-copy, requiring an account to purchase, etc).

{:.good}
We do not use dark patterns to drive user actions; in fact, we try our utmost to do the opposite (for instance with the design of our [usage tracking system](/sysadmin/tracking)).

#### Using Advertisements

Advertisements and sponsorships are both ethical and clearly identified with the product or service, only presenting them when they provide real economic and ethical value and don't diminish a visitor's experience.

{:.good}
We have no advertising.

#### Page Tracking

Remove unused and unconsented page tracking.

{:.good}
Manyfold itself has no page tracking, or any way to add it in short of changing the code. The Manyfold website uses [Umami](https://umami.is) privacy-preserving analytics to measure visits.

#### Search Engine Optimization

Optimization for search engines, social networks, and third-party services should be organically led with good coding practices and user-experience being the focus, not manipulating the services to gain greater priority through obfuscating content, pages, websites, or applications with redundancy or non-useful and optimized (to the visitor) material.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.12. [Document and Share Project Outputs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#document-and-share-project-outputs)

Everything produced by designers, developers, writers, and those involved with a project should be in an open format, well maintained, and curated in a common format (so everyone is working from the same model).

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Deliverables Reusability

The deliverables output, including documentation, are used upstream of the project and produced in ways that will allow it to be reused in subsequent projects.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Deliverables Documentation

Design functionality and technical specifications are documented so that deliverables are comprehensible by the project team and transferable to the development team.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Deliverables Readability

Ensure that developers have access to code comments and other View Source affordances which can reduce the burden to access, understand, maintain, and utilize production-ready code as this will reduce redundancy and foster an open source culture.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.13. [Use a Design System To Prioritize Interface Consistency](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-a-design-system-to-prioritize-interface-consistency)

Design systems allow common components and patterns to be formalized and managed within a website or application. By using such a tool, designers and developers can avoid reinventing existing tooling and thereby reduce wasted time (and emissions).

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Design System

Employ a design system based on web standards and recognizable patterns to mutualize interface components and provide a consistent experience for visitors.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.14. [Write With Purpose, in an Accessible, Easy To Understand Format](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#write-with-purpose-in-an-accessible-easy-to-understand-format)

Everyone should be able to understand what you've written without wasting time staring at a screen or jumping from page to page looking for answers, whether they have accessibility requirements or not. This also means avoiding using technical language (without explanations) and including enough information to help direct people (and search engines) from page to page.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Write Clearly

Write clearly, using plain, inclusive language delivered at an easy-to-understand reading level considering accessibility and internationalization inclusions as required (for example, dyslexia).

{:.ok}
We try to use simple concise language within the application, and our documentation is intended to be easy to read; however, as there is some level of technical detail involved, we can certainly do better.

#### Content Formatting

Deliver content formatted in ways that support how people read online, including a clear document structure, visual hierarchy, headings, bulleted lists, line spacing, and so on.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Search Engine Optimization (SEO)

Prioritize SEO at early design stages and throughout a product or service's lifecycle to improve content findability.

{:.bad}
We haven't considered SEO outside the approach of creating well-structured documents.

</details>

### Guideline 2.15. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Image Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-image-assets)

Of all the data that comprises the largest over-the-wire transfer rates within the average website or application, images are usually those that are responsible due to their quantity and usefulness. As such, doing all you can to reduce their size and unnecessary loading will be beneficial for sustainability.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Need For Images

Assess the need for images considering the quantity, format, and size necessary for implementation.

{:.good}
Manyfold uses very few unnecessary images, with the exception of our logo and icons from Bootstrap Icons.

#### Optimize Images

Resize, optimize, and compress each image (outside the browser), offering different sizes (for each image) for different screen resolutions.

{:.bad}
Models tend to contain images, which are often quite large. These should be optimized and turned into different sizes; this is now possible with Shrine, our new storage engine, which should make this straightforward.

#### Lazy Loading

Provide Lazy Loading to ensure image assets only load when they are required.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Sizing And Deactivation

Let the visitor select the display size, and provide the option to deactivate images.

{:.bad}
This is not currently an option.

#### Management And Usage

Set up a media management and use policy to reduce the overall impact of images, with criteria for media compression and file formats.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after

### Guideline 2.16. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Media Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-media-assets)

Video and audio-heavy websites are often those that can have significant sustainability costs in terms of storage and carbon intensity for viewers who have to process the media with their devices to watch them (draining batteries). Optimizing such assets as much as possible is critical for a sustainable product or service.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Need For Media

Assess the need for video or sound usage (including only when they add visitor value), and ban non-informative media (background media) including autoplaying functionality.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Optimize Media

Choose the right media to display by compressing according to the visitor's requirements, selecting the appropriate format, ensuring it works across browsers, and avoiding embedded player plugins.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Lazy Loading

Media requiring a lot of data to be downloaded on the client side (including the media itself) must be loaded via a facade (a non-functional, static, representational element).

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Labels And Choice

Increase visitor awareness and control by informing them of the length, format, and weight of the media; allowing media deactivation, and giving a choice of resolutions; all while providing alternative resolutions and formats.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Management And Usage

### Guideline 2.17. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Animation](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-animation)

Animation can be both CPU and GPU-intensive and have implications for accessibility. While visually appealing and useful in certain situations, care and attention should be taken when considering the use of a high emissions technology.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Need For Animation

Use animation only when it adds value to a visitor's experience, and not for decorative elements.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Avoid Overburdening

Progressively display an appropriate quantity of animation so as not to overburden the visitor or diminish expected device behavior.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Control Animation

Allow visitors to start, stop, pause, or otherwise control animated content.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

</details>

### Guideline 2.18. [Take a More Sustainable Approach to Typefaces](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#take-a-more-sustainable-approach-to-typefaces)

Since the advent of the modern web, the ability to include embedded fonts and provide a more customized experience has seen their use explode. They aren't always the most performant option (which poses emissions hazards) and come with a few issues such as Flash Of Unstyled Content (FOUC) / Flash Of Unstyled Text (FOUT) which should be addressed.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Default Typefaces

Use standard system-level (web-safe / pre-installed) fonts as much as possible.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Font Optimization

Ensure the number of fonts, and the variants within typefaces (such as weight and characters) are limited within a project, using the most performant file format available.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the

</details>

### Guideline 2.19. [Provide Suitable Alternatives to Web Assets](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#provide-suitable-alternatives-to-web-assets)

Media, images, fonts, and documents enrich the Internet. The problem is that people may not want to watch a video, listen to an audio file, look at an image, or use a specific application. By providing alternative formats to anything you embed, you ensure the widest possible audience can benefit from it (and reduced carbon output will occur as the alternative text will induce less consumer hardware thrashing than its rich media alternative).

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Open Formats

All proprietary file formats (such as PDF) should also be offered in HTML for accessibility and to ensure future availability.

{:.good}
We do not use any proprietary formats in our own work. The system can be used to index and manage files in proprietary formats, but that is beyond the scope of assessment.

#### Font Subsetting

All custom typefaces (using font-display) should be subsetted and offered as part of a font stack with a system font as a backup.

{:.todo}
Write assessment detail here.
Change paragraph class to "bad", "ok", "good", or "na" to set the
evaluation overall result, and set the relevant icon colour after
the guideline summary.

#### Alternative Text

All images should provide meaningful alternative text for screen reader users (or when images fail to load) accessibility.

{:.ok}
All of our built-in imagery has alternative text, but the images included in catalogued models do not. We do have a "caption" field for files, which could be displayed as alt text, but that's not currently editable, or displayed for images.

#### Audio Alternatives

Audio should provide text transcripts of conversations as an alternative to playing the media.

{:.na}
We have no audio content.

#### Video Alternatives

Video should provide text transcripts (at minimum), subtitles (using WebVTT), and for accessibility best practice, offer closed captions and sign language options.

{:.na}
We have no video content of this type.

</details>

### Guideline 2.20. [Provide Accessible, Usable, Minimal Web Forms](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#provide-accessible-usable-minimal-web-forms)

Understandably, businesses want to know more about their customers, but a key part of sustainability is being ethical towards visitors and as such, the right to privacy is considered paramount. Don't demand information when it's not required and not only will this help visitors complete transactions quicker (reducing emissions), it will help with legal compliance such as GDPR.

#### Form Simplicity

Assess the need for forms and reduce form content to the bare minimum necessary to meet the visitor's needs and the organization's business goals. Clearly communicate why a form is necessary, what its value proposition is, how many steps it will take to complete, and what an organization will do with collected data (informed consent).

{:.ok}
We aim to do this, by including explanatory text in forms, help text for inputs, and useful placeholders, but we can do it better and more consistently.

#### Form Functionality

Avoid auto-completion / auto-suggest if it would prove unhelpful (to conserve bandwidth) whilst allowing autofill for ease of repeat entry (including the use of helpful tooling such as password managers).

### Guideline 2.29. [Incorporate Compatibility Testing Into Each Release-Cycle](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#incorporate-compatibility-testing-into-each-release-cycle)

Compatibility is a critical part of the sustainability mindset and should be prioritized through all products and services. If individuals wish to use older devices (or cannot upgrade due to cost) or do not wish to upgrade as frequently, it will reduce the amount of e-waste that enters the system. If something doesn't work, it's also likely to result in visitors suffering a wasted effort, potentially leading to refused access to your service (and thereby emitting further emissions).

## Section 3. Web Development

### Guideline 3.1. [Identify Relevant Technical Indicators](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#identify-relevant-technical-indicators)

Performance is a key part of the sustainability mindset as reductions in loading times can have a considerable impact on energy loads within CPU, GPU, RAM, and hard drive caching (among other variables), as such ensuring a performant product is essential.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->

#### Accountancy Types

Because the payload being delivered may not always be equal in terms of energy intensity, operators of websites and applications must ensure that consideration is given for the energy intensity (or unit being evaluated) of each component. For example, non-rendering text is less computational than CSS, which in turn is less process-heavy than JavaScript, which is less resource-heavy than WebGL.

### Guideline 3.2. [Minify Your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#minify-your-html-css-and-javascript)

Whitespace holds no value when it's being presented to the visitor (unless they view the source code), by using minification, valuable data savings can be made which will reduce loading times.

<details markdown="block">

</details>

### Guideline 3.3. [Use Code-Splitting Within Projects](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-code-splitting-within-projects)

When dealing with heavy components (such as JavaScript), the ability to modularize them into smaller pieces that can be loaded as and when required reduces the amount of redundancy and serves as a great way to make your scripts more sustainable.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->

#### Code Splitting

Breakdown bandwidth-heavy components into segments that can be loaded as required.

{:.bad}
We do have some code-splitting in that the renderer is in a separate background worker script, but there are definitely things that are pulled into every page that aren't always needed, like the bulk editor code, selectize for tag editing, and more.

</details>

### Guideline 3.4. [Apply Tree Shaking To Code](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#apply-tree-shaking-to-code)

Often when coding, projects can accumulate clutter and functions that are no longer used (due to newer, more effective features being developed). By utilizing tree shaking techniques, all the "dead wood" will be automatically dropped upon compilation, reducing a file's size.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>

### Guideline 3.5. [Ensure Your Solutions Are Accessible](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#ensure-your-solutions-are-accessible)

Not everyone can access services equally, being sustainable is also about being accessible, fair, ethical, and ensuring that your product or service doesn't discriminate. As such, ensuring your website complies with best practices and relevant laws whilst meeting the needs of your visitors is critical as well as good business.

#### Accessibility Compliance

Your website or application must conform to WCAG (at the necessary level), plus extend beyond to obey relevant laws and meet additional visitor accessibility requirements. Building inclusively means that people with permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities will be able to more quickly find what they are looking for, and not have to spend extra time searching for a way to use your product or service.

{:.good}
We recently had an accessibility audit performed and have addressed all the findings.

#### Enhancing Accessibility

Enhance your website or application with Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA) ONLY if applicable or necessary, and accessibility enhancing features when useful or beneficial.

{:.good}
ARIA attributes are only added if actually useful - wherever possible we just use core semantic HTML attributes.

#### Electronic Inequalities

### Guideline 3.6. [Avoid Code Duplication](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#avoid-code-duplication)

Redundancy is the enemy of sustainability. Having systems in place to ensure that everyone can work from established patterns, the website or application remains clean and easy to use, and iteration over redesign is firmly in the mindset that will help promote sustainable practices. It's also worth being wary of abstracting code too early (see AHA methodology) or incorrectly, as while good abstractions can be more efficient, poor ones can waste effort and introduce complexity, bloat, and bugs to your codebase which can lead to emissions.

#### Third-party Preferences

Third-party products, services, libraries, and frameworks are often a source of sustainability issues that cannot be controlled or managed by the first-party provider of a service. While many do provide benefits to a website, the need to justify their inclusion should be made not only by those creating the product or service but also be able to be controlled by the consumer. As showcased with cookies, websites or applications should provide a similar mechanism of disabling or refusing non-first-party features (with explanations of their purpose) - unless such features can be proven as critical for functionality.

Sustainability benefits can be generated in numerous ways, by making sure that your website adheres to the requests made by a browser for specific conditions to be taken into account (such as CSS media and preference queries), you can unlock benefits for the visitor, and as a by-product reduce your emissions. It's worth noting that the introduction of user preferences and APIs has increased the risk of visitor fingerprinting and privacy issues.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Media and Preference Queries

Apply the monochrome, prefers-contrast, prefers-color-scheme, prefers-reduced-data, prefers-reduced-transparency, and prefers-reduced-motion CSS preference queries if they will benefit your website or application. Also, consider the print & scripting CSS media queries if they will improve the sustainability of your website.

{:.ok}
Bootstrap handles a lot of these automatically, but we should look into `prefers-contrast`, `monochrome`, and particularly `prefers-reduced-data`, because those are definitely things we could apply to the 3d renderer.

</details>

### Guideline 3.14. [Develop a Mobile-First Layout](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#develop-a-mobile-first-layout)

Visitors approach our products and services on a wide variety of devices these days. Ensuring that your device works on the widest range of devices and differing screen resolutions ensures that you will have a compatible website or application. As such, visitors can actively choose to browse on devices that emit less carbon if they wish.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Mobile-First

Allow a website or app to work on mobile devices primarily (testing with various connection speeds), expanding to accommodate larger displays thereafter (mobile-first). It is much more effective to do the hard work to ensure that it works well on a mobile device and then scale it up to larger interfaces.

{:.bad}
Manyfold is mobile-friendly, but definitely not mobile-first. We can do better.

#### Responsive Design

Utilize progressive enhancement and responsive web design to ensure that your work accommodates a device's capabilities, different screen sizes, and will not fail if it meets an unsupported technology.

{:.ok}
We use Bootstrap's responsive design to cope with different screen sizes, but there are some places where this doesn't work properly on small screens.

#### Carbon Aware Design

To maximize the use of renewable energy, adapt your website or service to electricity availability using carbon-aware design techniques. This should include using situational design to reduce the codebase or functionality during high-intensity periods or adapting the user-interface to perform better in situations where scaling hardware resources can be avoided to reduce emissions.

{:.bad}
We've not looked into this at all, and I didn't even know it was possible. We should find out more.

#### Alternative Browsing

Consider supporting other indirect methods of interaction such as voice (speech), code (QR, etc), reader view (browser, application, or RSS), or connected technology (watch, appliance, transport, etc).

### Guideline 3.15. [Use Beneficial JavaScript and Its APIs](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#use-beneficial-javascript-and-its-api-s)

When new best practices or if beneficial scripting guidance exists that will improve the visitor experience, following it should be of the highest priority (only using scripts ethically should be promoted).

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Beneficial JavaScript

Improve sustainability through accessible and performant code implementations.

{:.bad}
Performance is a goal and we've worked on it, though it could definitely be improved in many places. There are definitely parts of the code we know are taking far longer than they should.

#### API Requests

When using an API, make sure you only call it when necessary. On the other side, make sure no unrequired data is sent by the API.

{:.bad}
While we do try to minimise it, Manyfold still transfers a lot of 3d data that's not strictly necessary - there are more efficient ways we could provide the same experience to a user, such as an image preview of a model.

</details>

### Guideline 3.16. [Ensure Your Scripts Are Secure](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#ensure-your-scripts-are-secure)

The dangers of scripting are well known, and vulnerabilities are discovered with increasing regularity. As such, it's of ethical benefit for authors to ensure all code used regularly passes security processes.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Script Security

Check the code for vulnerabilities, exploits, header issues, and code injection.

{:.good}
Security audit was recently performed, and identified only a few issues, which have been fixes. Various code-scanning tools are also used to detect potential security issues.

</details>

### Guideline 3.17. [Manage Dependencies Appropriately](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#manage-dependencies-appropriately)

While JavaScript may not cause the most website bloat, it can cause very high emissions in terms of CPU load due to the rendering process, thereby it makes sense to consider the use of dependencies and third-party code carefully.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Dependency Management

Prevent developers from downloading and installing JavaScript libraries to run locally (client-side) when they are not needed by checking for unused dependencies and uninstalling those that aren't needed and removing them from your package.json file.

{:.good}
All our Javascript is packaged up and delivered directly, without any downloads from third parties.

#### Dependency Necessity

Reduce the amount of JavaScript that has to be downloaded and parsed by the browser by only using libraries where necessary. Consider whether you can use a native JavaScript API instead. Check the package size, and whether individual modules can be installed and imported rather than the whole library.

{:.ok}
There's almost certainly some code in the large libraries like THREE.js that we can avoid pulling in, but it should be removed by tree-shaking. We should be clearer on that though and make sure it's the case.

#### Dependency Updates

Regularly check dependencies and keep them up-to-date.

{:.good}
Dependencies are automatically maintained by Dependabot on GitHub, and pushed out with regular releases.

</details>

### Guideline 3.18. [Include Files That Are Automatically Expected](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#include-files-that-are-automatically-expected)

Search engines and browsers regularly examine websites, requesting specific files by default (they expect them to exist). If the files don't exist, this will lead to potential errors and emissions being caused when they could be created, especially as the files offer SEO, user-experience, and other benefits to visitors.

### Guideline 3.21. [Align Technical Requirements With Sustainability Goals](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#align-technical-requirements-with-sustainability-goals)

Every product or service is different, and each will require a different set of tooling to accomplish the most sustainable result. Deciding whether to go with a bulky framework, Static Site Generator (SSG), or a Content Management System (CMS) takes careful planning based on client or service requirements.

<details markdown="block">
<summary>
Criteria: ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣--> ⚪<!--🔴🟡🟢🟣-->
</summary>

#### Identify Requirements

List (and choose carefully) the requirements of the product or service. A simpler technological implementation may use more human resources but could have a smaller footprint. A prebuilt solution may use more system resources (and thereby produce more emissions upon render) but have a faster build-time (emitting less carbon during development).

#### Optimized Methodology

As a general rule, coding from scratch is the best-performing methodology (though if an existing solution is actively maintained, it may be better optimized than what you could produce). Therefore, prefer native components and file systems to a WYSIWYG editor or heavy framework, and be considerate of the impact of third-party solutions.

#### Static VS Dynamic

If you do decide to use a code generation tool, consider using a Static Site Generator in preference to a bulky content management system. Because SSGs often start using a minimalist content entry format (like markdown) and all of the compilation is done before the website is uploaded, the emissions benefit comes from the server not having to place as much effort into serving pages (as they are static) for each visitor. In the case of a CMS, the dynamic nature of a site will involve additional computation (server-side processing) and bulkier libraries.

{:.good}
Our core application is inherently dynamic, so this cannot be applied, but our documentation site is fully statically-generated using Jekyll.

#### Expandability Considerations

Plugins, extensions, and themes have been carefully reviewed and selected to maximize interoperability, accessibility, and performance. They are regularly audited over time to ensure continued compatibility.

### Guideline 4.2. [Optimize Browser Caching](https://w3c.github.io/sustyweb/#optimize-browser-caching)

Browser caching reduces the requirement for files to need to be constantly reloaded from the server, and in certain situations, it can even allow for files to be viewed offline (or in the case of a reverse proxy, send immediate recurring requests without additional calculation or computation from the server). As such, this will have sustainability and performance benefits (for instance by greatly reducing Time-To-First-Byte).

#### Lowest Requirements

Select infrastructure elements with the lowest requirements tier, meeting your service-level agreements. Avoid over-provisioning multi-datacenter, multi-zone, or distributed deployments if standalone instances meet the requirements. Also avoid provisioning infrastructure that will be under-utilized by provisioning for established average loads, ensuring reasonable resource utilization and autoscaling occurs as needed. Avoid provisioning for peak loads.
