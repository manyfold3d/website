Two Manyfold releases in a week? What a time to be alive! This one comes with another pile of interface improvements and little quality-of-life features. There's a new tidier account menu with "my stuff" links, better onboarding, confirmations for expensive operations, the ability to sort by updated date, and your selected sort will now persist across sessions!
