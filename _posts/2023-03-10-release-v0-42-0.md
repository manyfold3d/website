Lots of new stuff! You can now tell VanDAM how you want your files organised on disk. By creator? Collection? Tag? All of the above? Now you can! Even better, VanDAM will attempt to guess information for newly-scanned models based on the template. There are also lots of improvements around tagging, and some new library options like custom icons!
