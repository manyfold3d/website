This release is all about searchability; after all, if you publish something publicly, you want people to find it, right? Don't worry though, by default everything stays private and unindexable, as it always was.

We've added control over whether web crawlers are allowed to index the site, as well as per-item controls over whether or not a specific model (or creator or collection) should be indexed so that any user or item can be opted out (or in). We've also got defaults and per-item control for the AI training preference directives created by [Deviantart](https://www.foundationwebdev.com/2022/11/noai-noimageai-meta-tag-how-to-install/). We can't promise that web crawlers will respect these preferences of course; such is the wild nature of public content on the Internet.

We've also got more choices in the license list, and improved display of public/private access.
