title: Release v0.67.0

This release introduces optional, anonymous, as-private-as-possible usage tracking, purely so that we can answer the question "how many people are using Manyfold?". There is a detailed breakdown of exactly what data is collected and how we use it [in the admin manual](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/tracking.html), but in summary, we collect only the application version you're running, and we can't access or save it, other than getting aggregated statistics.

Privacy is super important to us, so we've put a lot of work in to make this as difficult for ourselves as possible! And of course, it's completely optional and off by default, so you can choose whether or not you want to report in.

Having said all that, letting us know is *super useful*, so if you're comfortable doing so, please please turn on the reporting in settings! ‚ù§Ô∏è
