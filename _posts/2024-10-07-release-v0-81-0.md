title: Release v0.81.0
date: 2024-10-07 11:53:26 UTC
---
There's a lot of work in this release, but perhaps not much is too visible. We're working on ActivityPub interoperability with platforms like Mastodon, and there's a lot of work under the hood to get us there. The visible ActivityPub interaction stuff is very near though, hopefully you'll get to see it within a week in v0.82.0!

This release does have a few bug fixes though, and a new feature whereby you can split a model's files into two parts through the bulk file editor. So, if you merged things by accident, now you can undo it!
