Now you can control who you share your stuff with - even the entire world if you want! You can grant per-item viewing, editing, or owner permissions, and you can grant them to all local users, individual users, or the general public so your stuff can be viewed without an account. By default, new and existing content will be available to view by all local users, which is the same as previous versions. But, admins can change that default in settings to make new items private instead.
