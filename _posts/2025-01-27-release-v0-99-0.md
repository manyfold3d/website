title: Release v0.99.0
date: 2025-01-27 14:24:07 UTC
---
Two main features in this release: first, you can now customise the ignored files and folders list for disk scanning, which should help keep things tidy; and second, we've got more federation support for creator profiles.

Now, if you follow a creator on another Manyfold instance, it will appear in your local creator list, and you can assign models to it, as well as easily visiting the original profile. You can also search for Fediverse addresses straight from the main search box - try following `@floppy@manyfold.floppy.org.uk` to see it in action!

There's more federation work coming soon, so stay tuned!
