This week's release brings some improvements to scanning processes. You can now run a metadata scan for any set of filtered models, including using a new search term for path matching, and you can run the new file check scan on an individual library.

There's also a new `manyfold links sync` command to batch-synchronise links, including a `--match` argument if you want to just sync with a single site, and errors with the sync will now be reported in the Problems list.
