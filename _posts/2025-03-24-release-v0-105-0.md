This release sees the first proper API endpoints for public models, creators and collections. It's a pretty standard JSON-LD REST API, and should be considered version zero; it will definitely change over time, but we're excited to see what can be done with it! Full documentation is at `/api` on every instance (including on [Try Manyfold](https://try.manyfold.app/api)), and is linked in the site footer. 

Authenticated access tokens for accessing private data will be coming soon, followed by being able to edit data and upload content.
