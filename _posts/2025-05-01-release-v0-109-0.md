Some new features for admins in this release, and some metadata parse and import improvements!

There is now a `bin/manyfold` command that can do various admin tasks, like cleaning up incorrect data; the [Advanced Tasks](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/advanced_tasks.html) page on the website explains how to use it.  You can now also set an upload quota for accounts, handy if you're running a public instance. You can set a site-wide default, then override it for each account individually.

Metdata parsing has been improved and made more reliable; "rescan all models" in the menu and "rescan all files" in a single model both now do the same thing, and will re-parse metadata from path templates and other sources. A new source for metadata is README files; they're now read into the model description automatically, but if it's a Thingiverse-formatted README, we also automatically try to set creator, title, and license.
