title: Release v0.131.0
date: 2026-01-09 15:00:15 UTC
---
This release adds the first part of a new feature to help out commercial creators; you can now manage "user groups" per creator, which lets you make a list of users and then share permissions on models with them. And as a bonus, we've added support and rendering for Rhino 3DM files.

We'll be building on this more in the next couple of releases, with the target of being able to let creators share content easily and automatically with their subscribers. At the moment the groups are basically functional, though it's not particularly obvious what to do with them; in the near future we'll write up a proper guide on how to use it, once it's all ready.
