This release brings improvements to ActivityPub federation, making it easier to browse and follow content on other servers, whether you're in Manyfold or on another Fediverse platform like Mastodon. We have a brand new translation into Japanese, and there's also a new option to hide Problems in bulk, which will should make managing large collections a bit easier.
