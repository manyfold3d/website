title: Release v0.132.0
date: 2026-01-29 13:53:21 UTC
---
In the last release, we added "user groups" for creators, letting you more easily manage large groups of users who you want to give permissions on models. This was aimed at supporting creators like the many on Patreon who create models for their subscribers. This release adds the remaining features to support that process.

You can now add people to groups based on their email address, and if they don't have a local account, they'll automatically be invited to create one! Existing users are also notified when they're added to a group. 

All this can be acheived through the API as well as manually through a browser, so now OAuth apps and API keys can now be created by any user with "contributor" permission or above; i.e. anyone with upload permission. We'll be writing a guide soon on exactly how to use the API and a tool like Zapier to connect up a Patreon tier to a Manyfold group, so you can fully automate distributing your content!

There are also a pile of bugfixes and minor improvements, as well as added support for opening 3MF files directly in Bambu Studio (other files formats don't seem to work directly via their URLs, so you'll still have to download STLs for now).
