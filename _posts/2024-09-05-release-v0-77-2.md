This release brings a few privacy improvements after the initial release of public sharing in v0.77.0; you can no longer predict URLs of models, and private tags are hidden.

NOTE: new ID strings are generated for all models and files during deployment; this might take some time on large libraries.

## What's Changed
### 🔒 Security 🔒
* Change ID numbers in URLs to more secure randomised strings by [@Floppy](https://github.com/Floppy) in [#2625](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2625)
* Only show public tags when logged out by [@Floppy](https://github.com/Floppy) in [#2627](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2627)
### 🐛 Bug Fixes 🐛
* Restore automatic login in single user mode by [@Floppy](https://github.com/Floppy) in [#2626](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2626)
### 🛠️ Other Improvements 🛠️
* Don't show sharing settings in single-user mode by [@Floppy](https://github.com/Floppy) in [#2628](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/pull/2628)
