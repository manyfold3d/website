title: Release v0.121.0
date: 2025-08-12 11:59:32 UTC

This release is mostly invisible background work for future features, though there are a few little improvements you might notice.

* You can now enable generation of thumbnail-sized images to help lists load quicker (currently in "downloads" settings; no it's not a good place)
* 3D files now show their dimensions in the detail page, thanks to a much more efficient file analysis tool which we'll be doing a lot more with in future
* You can command library filesystem scans from the CLI - useful for cron jobs maybe!
* Basic support for "Fediverse Auxiliary Service Providers" (FASPs). This is a system built as part of the Fediscovery project which aims to solve the problems with federated search, new instances with empty timelines, etc. It's early days, and there aren't any real servers out there you can connect up to yet, but that should change over the next few months, and we're getting ready for it.

And one more thing; the Advanced Admin UI has been removed. It was only ever a stopgap until the rest of the application got the features it needed, which we think we've hit now. If there's anything you used that you can't do, open a feature request and we'll get a replacement in for you.
