This release is all about the API! We've had a read-only API for a few releases now, but this release brings the ability to update and create data as well.

First, you'll need to create an OAuth application in the settings area, with the appropriate scopes. You can then use it to create, edit and delete all the basic data for creators and collections, and update metadata for models and files. That means that, for instance, you could write a script to import data from another hosting site. The best way to explore the API is to try it live from the API documentation; just click "Authorise" and paste in your app credentials!

There are a few things that aren't in there yet; problems, permissions, admin capabilities, and you can't yet upload new files, but all that will be coming in future releases, so stay tuned!
