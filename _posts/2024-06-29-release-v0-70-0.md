This releases brings BIG changes to the upload process. Firstly, file upload progress is shown as it happens, so you can see what's going on; then, the extraction of zip files happens in the background, so you can carry on using Manyfold while it happens. Models are created straight away, without the need for a full scan, so the "scan after upload" button has gone away. And finally, perhaps our single most popular feature request - you can now upload individual files as new models! So, no need to zip up a single STL any more.

We're certainly going to build on this more, with options like uploading files into an existing model, and renaming models during the upload process, which you can see on the [feature roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/manyfold3d/projects/4).

We've also made changes to the way the background processing works. Expensive jobs like geometric analysis and file conversion may now take a little longer to work through by default, but they shouldn't saturate the server and stop other things happening in the meantime. You can control the concurrency of the background runners using the new `DEFAULT_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` and `PERFORMANCE_WORKER_CONCURRENCY` options, which are set to 4 and 1 by default. If you have lots of CPU and memory on your server, you can bump those up.

The underlying change that's enabled all of this is a big rewrite of the actual file storage engine. You shouldn't notice any difference, although this enables some great stuff in future, like support for cloud storage.

NOTE: it may take a long time to migrate data during the upgrade, depending on the size of your library, perhaps in the region of 10-20 seconds per gigabyte.

If you have any problems, as always, come say hi in our very helpful [support chat](https://matrix.to/#/#manyfold:matrix.org) or file a [bug report](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/new?assignees=&labels=bug&projects=&template=bug_report.md&title=) on GitHub.
