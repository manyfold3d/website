title: Release v0.80.0
date: 2024-09-24 13:48:05 UTC
---
This release is all about bugs! Along with v0.79.0, it includes fixes for every high-priority bug we wanted to fix for v1.0.0. A lot of these have been around for a long time, so it's great to get them closed!

Having said that though, there are a few new features too. First of all, we have a Spanish translation thanks to some fantastic work by [@juanjomurga](https://github.com/juanjomurga)! Also, you can now use Markdown in model descriptions (used to be notes), and they're displayed under the image carousel in your models, just like you'd expect on any other model hosting site. Manyfold will also raise problems for missing metadata, like links, creators, tags, or license. To enable those, change them from "ignored" to "info" in settings. We knew there would be a lot, so we left them hidden by default üòÑ
