title: Release v0.55.0
date: 2024-01-29 11:22:07 UTC
---
In this, the first release of many in 2024. we have some new features. You can now set license information for models, and you can choose how important different problems are when displayed - including whether to hide them completely!

This is also the first release that's supported by NLNet's NGI Zero Entrust fund; the fund is supporting development for the next few months, so there will be lots coming down the line! See https://floppy.org.uk/blog/2024/01/22/new-beginnings/ for more information.

In non-feature news, we also now have a new website at https://manyfold.app, and a demo instance where you can try before you install, at https://try.manyfold.app.
