title: Release v0.90.0
date: 2024-11-25 12:03:08 UTC
---
This release focuses on site administration and user management, with a redesign of the site settings area and a new user management section for moderators/admins. You can now also require moderator approval for new accounts, so you can let people sign themselves up, but also check that you want to let them in before they can access everything.

Also, there's a change to the usage reporting; we've added the image name and system architecture to the report. This lets us see which image you're running (standard, solo, linuxserver), and also which CPU architecture you're on. At some point we'll deprecate the 32-bit ARM build and it would be good to know how many people are using it before we do. As always the exact data sent is visible in the admin area, and the aggregated stats are visible to all at [tracking.manyfold.app/stats](https://tracking.manyfold.app/stats). If you haven't already, please consider enabling the anonymous usage tracking; it *really* helps us out. (This change is listed as a "breaking change" in the changelog below as we feel it's important to highlight - you don't actually need to do anything though)
