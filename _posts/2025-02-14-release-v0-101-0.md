Now that Manyfold instances can connect to each other, it might be pretty handy to be able to tell which one you're looking at. So, we've now got themes! You can easily select one of 26 different looks for your instance, thanks to the great [Bootswatch](https://bootswatch.com) theme collection. Just go to the new "appearance" settings page to choose your favourite!

We've also got the usual bugfixes, but there's one really big one; we can now render 3MF files that use the "production extension" properly! So, if you've saved your slicer projects as 3MF, downloaded something with print information already added, or had another sort of 3MF file that wasn't rendering, hopefully you'll find it's now working properly!
