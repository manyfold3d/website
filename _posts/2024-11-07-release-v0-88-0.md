title: Release v0.88.0

This release was just going to be bugfixes, but then we added support for a load of new file formats, particularly ones used for stuff like game development or higher-end graphics work. So, you can now index Collada (DAE), FBX, IGES, DXF, 3DS/MAX, Maya, Modo, Sketchup and even more. Take a look at the [supported formats](https://manyfold.app/manual/supported_formats.html) page on the website for the full list!

There's also an important bug fix for OIDC login, which should fix issues with the redirect URL being incorrect.
