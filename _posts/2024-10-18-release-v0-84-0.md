If you're on a public or shared instance, this might be helpful; now you can mark models as "sensitive" (i.e. NSFW, or otherwise something to be careful about). You can also choose how you want to display sensitive items; you can show them normally, blur them in the lists, or you can hide them completely!

There are also a couple of high-priority bugfixes for database migrations that were causing problems in v0.83.0.
