This release adds another long-requested feature, a big download button for an entire model! No, I'm not sure how it took this long either. But, there's not just one download button - there are options! You can download just the supported files, just the unsupported, or just one particular file type! 

Note: The downloads are generated on the fly (and cached for 6 hours), so for large models it might take a little while to start downloading; we'll get some UI feedback for that into a future release so you can see what's happening.
