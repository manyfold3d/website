Say hello to v.0.75.0 of Manyfold, in which we take our first steps into a larger world! We're excited to announce that we've added experimental early-stage support for ActivityPub, the decentralized social protocol that powers the [Fediverse](https://www.fediverse.to/) (think Threads, Mastodon, Pixelfed, Peertube, etc).

At the moment, only following and creating are supported for Models, Creators, and Collections, and only on your own instance - nothing federated actually works yet, but that's coming soon. This is just our first baby step. You probably won't notice much difference other than a follow button that doesn't actually do much!

Safety and privacy are always a priority, so of course, this is only enabled if you're running in multiuser mode, and there will be plenty of control over what's shared when cross-server federation becomes available; we aren't just going to open up your collections to the world without you being fully in control.
