title: Release v0.83.0

We've all got too many passwords; so, this release adds experimental support for single sign-on using OpenID Connect (OIDC)!

We say "experimental" because OIDC is a big world with many providers, so it's entirely possible that there will be problems we've not found yet; if you find that your provider doesn't work as you'd expect, [report a bug](https://github.com/manyfold3d/manyfold/issues/new) and we'll get it fixed. Take a look at [the authentication config docs](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/configuration.html#authentication) for details of how to set it up.

There are also new config options for [customising your site](https://manyfold.app/sysadmin/configuration.html#customisation). Not every site can just be called "Manyfold", that'll be confusing, so now you can change the title, tagline, and icon to something more personal!

We've ALSO added a few new formats; FeeeCAD, BRep, and Markdown. Enjoy!
